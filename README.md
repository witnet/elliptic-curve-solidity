`elliptic-curve-solidity` is an open source implementation of Elliptic Curve arithmetic operations written in Solidity.

_DISCLAIMER: This is experimental software. **Use it at your own risk**!_

The solidity contracts have been generalized in order to support any elliptic curve based on prime numbers up to 256 bits.

`elliptic-curve-solidity` has been designed as a library with **only pure functions** aiming at decreasing gas consumption as much as possible. Additionally, gas consumption comparison can be found in the benchmark section. This library **does not check whether the points passed as arguments to the library belong to the curve**. However, the library exposes a method called *`isOnCurve`* that can be utilized before using the library functions.

It contains 2 solidity libraries:

1. `EllipticCurve.sol`: provides main elliptic curve operations in affine and Jacobian coordinates.
2. `FastEcMul.sol`: provides a fast elliptic curve multiplication by using scalar decomposition and wNAF scalar representation.

`EllipticCurve` library provides functions for:

- Modular
  - inverse
  - exponentiation
- Jacobian coordinates
  - addition
  - double
  - multiplication
- Affine coordinates
  - inverse
  - addition
  - subtraction
  - multiplication
- Auxiliary
  - conversion to affine coordinates
  - derive coordinate Y from compressed EC point
  - check if EC point is on curve

`FastEcMul` library provides support for:

- Scalar decomposition
- Simultaneous multiplication (computes 2 EC multiplications using wNAF scalar representation)

## Supported curves

The `elliptic-curve-solidity` contract supports up to 256-bit curves. However, it has been extensively tested for the following curves:

- `secp256k1`
- `secp224k1`
- `secp192k1`
- `secp256r1` (aka P256)
- `secp192r1` (aka P192)
- `secp224r1` (aka P224)

Known limitations:

- `deriveY` function do not work with the curves `secp224r1` and `secp224k1` because of the selected derivation algorithm. The computations for this curve are done with a modulo prime `p` such that `p mod 4 = 1`, thus a more complex algorithm is required (e.g. *Tonelli-Shanks algorithm*). Note that `deriveY` is just an auxiliary function, and thus does not limit the functionality of curve arithmetic operations.
- the library only supports elliptic curves with `cofactor = 1` (all supported curves have a `cofactor = 1`).

## Usage

`EllipticCurve.sol` library can be used directly by importing it.

The [Secp256k1](https://github.com/witnet/elliptic-curve-solidity/blob/master/examples/Secp256k1.sol) example depicts how to use the library by providing a function to derive a public key from a secret key:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.15;

import "elliptic-curve-solidity/contracts/EllipticCurve.sol";


contract Secp256k1 {

  uint256 public constant GX = 0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798;
  uint256 public constant GY = 0x483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B8;
  uint256 public constant AA = 0;
  uint256 public constant BB = 7;
  uint256 public constant PP = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F;

  function derivePubKey(uint256 privKey) public pure returns(uint256 qx, uint256 qy) {
    (qx, qy) = EllipticCurve.ecMul(
      privKey,
      GX,
      GY,
      AA,
      PP
    );
  }
}
```

The cost of a key derivation operation in Secp256k1 is around 550k gas.

```bash
·--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------·

··················|··········|··········|··········|············|··············
```

The cost of a simultaneous multiplication (using wNAF) consumes around 35% of the gas required by 2 EC multiplications.
